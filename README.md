# Chess
Chess implementation in C++

This project simulates all the possible moves in chess including the special moves i.e. Castling, En Passant and Pawn Promotion. The main program simulates some error moves before resetting and moving to a game between Alekhine and Vasic (1931), followed by resetting and playing a stalemate chess game. The visuals in the terminal are turned off but can be toggled back on by uncommenting lines 54, 119, 126 on ChessBoard.cpp. This project was the final C++ coursework as part of MSc Computing Science at Imperial College London.

To run the program, compile it using ```make``` and the run with ```./chess```
